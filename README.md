### Geographical Gaussian Process Regression
Geographical Gaussian Process Regression (GGPR): A Spatial Machine Learning Model Based on Spatial Similarity.
### Problem Statement
1.Most existing ML in spatial data can lead to overly optimistic performance and biased errors due to the conflict between spatial autocorrelation and the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption.

2.Spatial ML models based on spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity often require dense samples to satisfy the spatial stationarity assumption, making them inappropriate for small-sample prediction.

3.Few studies offered explainable tools to interpret black-box ML models and capture spatial effects for assisting the spatially decision-making research.

### Abstract
This study proposes a new spatial machine learning model called Geographical Gaussian Process Regression (GGPR). GGPR is extended from Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) by using the principle of spatial similarity for calibration, and it is designed to conduct spatial prediction and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). GGPR addresses several key challenges in spatial machine learning. First, as a probabilistic model, GGPR avoids the conflict between spatial autocorrelation and the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thus enhancing the modelâ€™s objectivity and reliability in spatial prediction. Second, GGPR is suitable for small-sample prediction that most existing models can hardly handle. Finally, integrated with GeoShapley, GGPR is an explainable model can measure spatial effects and explain the outcomes. Evaluated on two distinct datasets, GGPR demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to other popular machine learning models across various sampling ratios, with its advantage becoming particularly pronounced at smaller sampling ratios. As an ESDA model, GGPR demonstrates enhanced accuracy, better computational efficiency, and a comparable ability to measure spatial effects against both Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) and Geographical Random Forests (GRF). In short, GGPR offers spatial data scientists a new method for predicting and exploring complex geographical processes.
